# My config of Neovim

Here is my config of neovim.

## Usage

Just clone this repository into directory `~/.config/nvim/` and start neovim. [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) will auto install itself and other plugins at startup.

```
git clone <url of this repo> ~/.config/nvim
```

By default, this config will only include a few plugins, which suit for mataining other than editing frequently.

If you want to use the full feature this config provided, create a file named `_full_feature` under the root of this repo (usually `~/.config/nvim`.

```
touch ~/.config/nvim/_full_feature
```
